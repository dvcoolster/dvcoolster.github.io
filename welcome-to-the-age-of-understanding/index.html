  <h1>Welcome to the Age of Understanding</h1>
<p>12th November 2017<p>
<br>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for dropping by. As we begin to talk further with each other, I’ll
just lay down all of my thoughts for you. This way whenever we talk, you have a
sense of where I am coming from. As I learn from your thoughts, we shall keep
the communication going, and hopefully build an exciting future.</p>
<p>Firstly, I don’t work without, <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>And I like to ask that in all interviews, <em>‘I don’t know, I am looking to
find out.’</em> is a perfect answer. The problem is when you have not given it a
thought. Why do you want to work here, why do you want to work anywhere?</p>
<p>I am lucky that I can afford to solve that problem for myself. Many people
aren’t. People have to keep working in their tiring industrial age jobs with no
<em>Time or Energy</em> left to think. They are forced to bound their thoughts
in a limited Space-Time. To truly maximize the returns of information age, it’s
a must that we free human thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Unless we begin to think deeper with focus, we are heading towards a
‘Noise Age’ rather than ‘Information Age’</em></p>
<p>In the evolutionary process of our society, technology creates fear. It’s a
fact that people are losing their jobs, education system is failing, Governments
are closing borders, planet itself is being heavily damaged, people are afraid
of terrorism, human DNA has become editable, income divide doesn’t look like
stopping.</p>
<p>Where are we heading to? This fear of unknown forces each of us to keep our
guard up.</p>
<p>There’s chaos all around, and unless we learn to focus, the information will
drift us, unless we develop courage to walk right through the unknown, hold it
by its throat and bring it to what we desire, we are not among the best our
species has seen. Then again, before all of that we must ask,</p>
<p><strong>What do we desire? What do we fear?</strong></p>
<p>As one begins to broaden the ‘Space-Time’ of thoughts. They are forced to
face the truth of <em>‘Time’ &amp; ‘Death’</em>, and if you keep moving on, like
everybody before you, and everybody after you, you will face a simple question,
‘Purpose ?’</p>
<p>I have heard various answers. Many people conclude that there’s no purpose.
Many people want to reach ‘God’. Many people want to help humanity. Everyone
always wants to be happy, never met a guy who said don’t wanna be happy. In
varied forms,<br>I have seen people find their purpose, themselves in
<em>‘Knowledge’, ‘Love’ or ‘Work’.</em></p>
<p>You give your life to any of these you’re a genius, all of them, probably
_/\_</p>
<p>Searching ‘Why?’ will lead to philosophy, but a philosophy that can’t be
practiced is of no use to us. Therefore, we are going to be focussed on actions
we do, and results we see.</p>
<p>Personally, when I imagine the year 2100, I think it’s too sexy to leave it
afar. I imagine an age of understanding, where we have made it extremely costly
for any violence. We’ve all realized that it’s profitable to think, to love, to
be honest.</p>
<p><em>We’ve realized it’s profitable to just be human!</em></p>
<p>It’s our job to use what separates us from every other animal, what
differentiates us from the machines we make, <em>Our Brain</em>.</p>
<p>I know people like to say Data is the fuel of Information age. But, I believe
information is the fuel of information age. I discuss this when we ask
fundamentally <em>What is any information?</em></p>
<p>These same words will be understood in as many ways as many people read it.
Every individual who’s reading is unique, and processes this data on his
own.</p>
<p>Data is everywhere, from the light that enters our eyes, to the sounds we
hear, all of the subtleties we observe, spread over time, memories, biases, etc.
is processed by our brain. It operates like a mathematical model and produces a
resultant information in our mind. A probabilistic quantum interpretation. That
information is the real fuel of Information age, on the basis of which we decide
all of our actions, not just all the data.</p>
<p>Communication information begins and ends in human brains. I have written
pretty deeply about it, our limitation of expression is fundamental, as our
thoughts are quantum, our language is binary. Language can never truly express
what we think/feel.</p>
<p>If there’s value in our thoughts, then it surely is being wasted. Evidently,
a lot is garbage quality, but how do we improve?</p>
<p>Information age fundamentally depends upon we making sure that anyone and
everyone can think anywhere, act on it anywhere, and if there’s a possibility of
a market out there for his expression, is able to make his living of it.
<em>Unless thinking fundamentally helps me improve my living, why should I
think? </em></p>
<p>Meeting other cultures, reading books, traveling, exploring, all of these
things help us broaden our thoughts. I have not found a better way to work on
thoughts than discussing them fearlessly with the smartest people I know.</p>
<p>Among all of this, at times I used to fear the power of ‘Facebook’, ‘Google’.
Will there ever be something that can fundamentally challenge them?</p>
<p>As I write this, I have no doubt that the power of individual is on horizon.
In many sense, its already here. But, the friction is high, and as it’s said,
<em>“Removing friction is the job of Startup”</em>. There are going to be
multiple, multi-Billion Dollar opportunities, it’s inevitable. We shall carry on
discussing these in depth and more.</p>
<p><strong>What’s my purpose?</strong></p>
<p>It’s laid all over my thoughts. Fundamentally, though I am a Gamer, and I
have never found a better game than ‘Life’. I enjoy being present each
moment.</p>
<p>It’s been a long first post. There are directions you can go from here. Feel
free to let me know whatever was incomprehensible. Do remember, we are focussing
hard, bringing in information from several fields, and attempting to see a faint
image of future.</p>
<p>Thinking is hard, communicating is tiresome. But, we must carry on
because,</p>
<p><em>Unless we can dream it, how can we create it?</em></p>

<li>The challenges, opportunities and fear remain largely unchanged.</li>
<li>If you replace Computer with Cryptocurrencies, you can still make
sense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thinking Bigger<ul>
<li>If we take time to 4 Billion+ years our life is a speck of dust.</li>
<li>if we take space to even our Galaxy, our species is a speck of dust.</li>
<li>So, what do we mean when we say think bigger?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expression, interaction and next phase of Social Media<ul>
<li>There’s garbage all around.</li>
<li>With the power of expression comes loads of noise.</li>
<li>What is the next phase?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various dimensions of Information?<ul>
<li>The word we hear everyday, but what is it anyway?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limitation of Language as a Tool<ul>
<li>How much do I love you?</li>
<li>We don’t have answers to simple questions.</li>
<li>Language is a tool made by us, we must understand it’s limitations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Money for your thoughts?<ul>
<li>Why do we want to make thinking profitable?</li>
<li>Any method for madness? Ideas?</li>
<li>Creation and importance of Markets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google, Facebook: Challenges for unchallengeable<ul>
<li>Fairly young internet. Major innovations lie ahead.</li>
<li>Creators not being rewarded. Gatekeeper power similar to 1984.</li>
<li>Death of Publishing industry. Solutions in Blockchain?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of my thoughts are interlinked with other thoughts. You’re in worm
hole, that I am digging as you’re exploring, and explore we must.</p>
